    "This notebook details the process of training a Siamese Neural Network designed to create a fine-tuned embedding space of image vectors. This supervised training method uses Contrastive loss between pairs of images to bring embeddings closer or further apart according to their similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this expensive labeling domain of similarity between pairs of images, an active learning method is used to find the most informative pairs to label, while minimizing the total number of labels possible in the resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process was done in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initial small random sample of pairs of images were labeled, from [round0.csv](active_learning_labels/round_0.csv), and divided into training and evaluation. \n",
    "2. The network is trained on the data of the last round only, for 100 epochs. If a previous network was already trained, the training is continued from a saved checkpoint.\n",
    "3. The evaluation of the network is done on the evaluation set as a general guide for the learning capacity of the network. The F1 metric was used due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset.\n",
    "4. The network is used to determine the confidence of the similarity of unlabeled pairs of images. The pairs with the highest confidence were selected for labeling, up to a budget of ~120 pairs.\n",
    "5. Additionally, the network is used to determine the confidence of the similarity on samples automatically tagged with 0, and added those to the labeled set for the next round as well.\n",
    "6. Steps 2 until 5 are repeated, for a total of 4 rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of the active learning method is logged in this repository. In [active_learning_labels](active_learning_labels) are the labeled pairs of images for each round, and also a blind test set selected independently of the model. In [active_learning_models](active_learning_models) are the checkpoints of the models trained in each round. In [active_learning_results](active_learning_logs) are the logs of the training and evaluation of the models in each round."

      "/tmp/ipykernel_7280/1105050611.py:7: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

      "/tmp/ipykernel_7280/1548265267.py:3: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
